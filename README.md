Project description
------------

The advent of modern molecular biology has resulted in the increased ability to perform human identification (HID) in forensics. Nevertheless, traditional DNA typing provides a way to determine only whether two samples (one from the crime scene, and the other from the suspect) are from the same person. That is why this technology is of little use in absence of a suspect. Prediction of human externally visible characteristics seeks to get past this limitation by using the DNA left at a crime scene to create a genetically based description of the unknown suspectâ€™s appearance that can be used to narrow the search for suspects.

With accumulation of information about human genetics, forensic DNA phenotyping technologies are showing great promise, but accuracy of phenotypic traits prediction with currently published methods remains insufficient for routine use. One of the key challenges in phenotype prediction is a subjectivity of traits description, during both development and validation of models and prediction results interpretation. Several methods of phenotypic traits measurement, at most based on digital image analysis, have been published recently, but none of them currently widely used.

One of the Parseq Lab Company projects is development of complex MPS (Massively Parallel Sequencing) solution for forensics, including Phenotype prediction assay for human pigmentation, male pattern baldness and blood type. One of the issues in development and validation of human pigmentation prediction models is implementation of easy, precise and objective method of target phenotypic traits determination.

Project goals

### Main goal

Improvement of phenotype prediction based on genotype data by quantitative measurement of human phenotypic traits, in particular, pigmentation.

### Project objectives

* obtain an insight into published methods of quantitative measurement of human phenotypic traits (eyes, hair and skin pigmentation; male pattern baldness stage)
* selection of the most appropriate measurement method (instruments and conditions for measurements, algorithm of image analysis) for each of traits
* development of an algorithm of image processing and its usage considerations
* performance evaluation of the application by applying to a subset of volunteers
* analysis of targeted MPS sequencing results for loci associated with phenotypic traits of interest for the set of volunteers examined
* improvement of published phenotypic traits prediction models based on usage of new traits measurement methods and comparison of results with ones derived by initial models
